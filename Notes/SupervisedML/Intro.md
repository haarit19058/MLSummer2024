# What is Machine Learning

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Checkers Game made by Arthur which played many games with itself and learned the good or bad positions and moves.

# Supervised Learning

Algorithm that learns x ->y or input to output mappings.

You give the algo the input output pairs that have right answers and it learns from it.
It means that you feed the data(infinte lol data) with outputs and the algo learns from it and applies it to upcoming decisions.

Applications - spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving car, visual inspection

Regression: Housing Price Prediction
Linear Regression

Classification: Breast Cancer Detection

Tumor is malignant(dangerous) or benign(non-dangerous). These tumors are of different sizes. Map the data of malignant or not on y axis and tumor size on x axis.

The algo will determine whether the tumor is malignant or not based on the size of the tumor from previous data.


Classification algos predicts categories. like cat or dog and malignant or benign 

Two or more inputs.
We added Age,Tumor Size and based on that we determinw whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

# Unsupervised Learning

We are given data. Find something interesting in the unlabeled data.

Clustering: Google News, DNA microarray

In short in unsupervised learning we feed the data and then find some common ground and define properties.

Data comes with only input and algorithm has to find structure or trend in the data

Clustering - Anomaly Detection - Dimensionality Reduction



# Linear Regression Model

House sizes and price data

## Terminology 
Data set used to train the model is called training set. 

See the ipynb file

# Gradient Descent
